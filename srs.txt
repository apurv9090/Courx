Youâ€™re building an Online Course Dashboard using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with Razorpay for payment integration.

Hereâ€™s a clean, professional SRS (Software Requirements Specification) document â€” complete with all functional and non-functional requirements, system overview, modules, and use cases â€” customized exactly for your project.

ðŸ§¾ Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
For: Online Course Dashboard ðŸŽ“

Technology Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
Payment Gateway: Razorpay

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the software requirements for the Online Course Dashboard, a web-based learning platform that allows educators to upload and manage courses, and students to enroll, learn, and track their progress. The document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements, system design constraints, and technology stack used to implement the system.

1.2 Scope

The Online Course Dashboard aims to provide a seamless digital learning experience for students.

Educators can create, upload, and manage courses with video lectures and quizzes.

Students can browse available courses, enroll, make payments via Razorpay, and track their learning progress.

Admins can monitor users, course performance, and transactions.

The system will be developed using the MERN Stack for efficient full-stack implementation and Razorpay for secure payment processing.

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective

The system is a standalone web application that integrates the following modules:

Frontend: React.js (for UI/UX and course interaction)

Backend: Node.js & Express.js (for server logic and APIs)

Database: MongoDB (for data storage)

Payment Integration: Razorpay API (for handling course payments securely)

2.2 Product Functions

User Authentication (Sign Up, Login, Logout)

Role-based Access (Admin, Instructor, Student)

Course Management (Create, Edit, Delete, Publish)

Course Enrollment & Payment

Video Content Streaming

Progress Tracking and Completion Status

Dashboard Analytics for Students & Instructors

Razorpay Payment Gateway Integration

Profile Management

Reviews & Ratings

2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
User Type	Description	Access Level
Admin	Manages users, courses, and transactions.	Full Access
Instructor	Creates and manages courses, uploads content.	Medium Access
Student	Views, purchases, and learns from courses.	Limited Access
2.4 Operating Environment

Frontend: React.js (with Redux / Context API for state management)

Backend: Node.js + Express.js REST API

Database: MongoDB (Cloud - MongoDB Atlas)

Server Environment: Linux / Windows

Browser Compatibility: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari

Payment Gateway: Razorpay

2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

Razorpay integration requires HTTPS (SSL) for secure payments.

MongoDB connection string and Razorpay credentials must be stored securely in environment variables.

The system must be responsive for mobile and desktop users.

Proper authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies

Users have a stable internet connection.

Razorpay API services are available.

Node.js and MongoDB are installed and configured correctly.

Payment data is processed by Razorpay, not stored locally.

3. Functional Requirements
3.1 User Authentication Module

FR1: Users can register with email and password.

FR2: Users can log in using valid credentials.

FR3: Passwords must be hashed using bcrypt before storing in MongoDB.

FR4: JWT tokens are used for session management.

FR5: Forgot password functionality via email OTP verification.

3.2 Course Management Module

FR6: Instructors can add, edit, delete, and publish courses.

FR7: Courses include title, description, video lectures, thumbnail, price, and duration.

FR8: Students can view course details before enrollment.

FR9: Courses are categorized by subject, level, and instructor.

3.3 Payment & Enrollment Module

FR10: Students can enroll in a course after successful payment through Razorpay.

FR11: Razorpay order ID and transaction status are stored in MongoDB.

FR12: Users can view payment history and invoices.

FR13: Failed or incomplete payments do not grant access to course content.

3.4 Learning & Progress Tracking

FR14: Students can stream course videos after enrollment.

FR15: System tracks course progress (e.g., watched videos, completed sections).

FR16: Dashboard displays percentage completion of each course.

3.5 Review & Rating Module

FR17: Students can rate and review courses after completion.

FR18: Average rating is displayed on course details page.

3.6 Admin Dashboard

FR19: Admin can view all registered users, instructors, and courses.

FR20: Admin can deactivate or delete users/courses if necessary.

FR21: Admin can monitor all transactions made through Razorpay.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
4.1 Performance Requirements

The system should load the homepage within 3 seconds.

API calls should respond within 500 ms under normal load.

Must support at least 10,000 users concurrently.

4.2 Security Requirements

All passwords must be stored in encrypted form.

JWT tokens must be used for secure authentication.

Razorpay integration must be over HTTPS.

Sensitive data (keys, tokens) must not be exposed in the frontend.

4.3 Reliability

The system should handle unexpected shutdowns and resume normal operation.

MongoDB replication to prevent data loss.

4.4 Usability

The interface should be intuitive for users of all ages.

The dashboard should have a clear layout for progress tracking.

4.5 Maintainability

Code must follow modular architecture (MVC or component-based).

API routes should be well-documented.

4.6 Scalability

MongoDB must support scaling as the number of users and courses increase.

Cloud hosting (AWS, Render, or Vercel) for horizontal scaling.

4.7 Portability

Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

5. System Architecture Overview

Frontend: React.js â†’ handles UI, routing, and course rendering
Backend: Node.js + Express.js â†’ handles API requests and business logic
Database: MongoDB â†’ stores user profiles, courses, and payment records
Payment Integration: Razorpay â†’ handles course purchase transactions

Architecture Flow:

User visits frontend and requests data.

React sends API call to Express backend.

Backend queries MongoDB and returns data.

For payment, backend requests Razorpay API for order creation.

Razorpay verifies payment and notifies backend.

Backend updates MongoDB and grants course access.
